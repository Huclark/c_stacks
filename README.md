## About
This program is a simple implementation of stack in C.

## Objective
I wrote this program in order to gain a fair understanding on how Stack in C is implemented. In this program I implement stacks using arrays in C.

## Installation
Clone the repository using the command:
```
git clone https://github.com/Huclark/c_stacks.git
```

## Usage
This program presents the user with four options:<br>

	1. Push - Inserts element<br>
	2. Pop - Deletes the last element<br>
	3. Show - Lists all elements in stack<br>
	4. End - Exits the program<br>
Firstly, `cd` into the repository and use `./stacks` to run program.

### Example:

#### push()
`push()` the number `"5"` onto the stack:<br>
```
Hello there!
Below are the operations you can execute on the stack:
1. Push (Insert an element)
2. Pop (Deletes last element)
3. Show (Lists all elements in the stack)
4. Quit (Exit program)

Please enter your choice from 1 to 4: 1

Please enter the integer to be added to the stack: 5
```
#### show()
`show()` the elements on the stack:<br>
```
Below are the operations you can execute on the stack:
1. Push (Insert an element)
2. Pop (Deletes last element)
3. Show (Lists all elements in the stack)
4. Quit (Exit program)

Please enter your choice from 1 to 4: 3

List of integers in stack: 
Element 0: 5
```
#### pop()
`pop()` the number `"5"` from the stack: <br>
```
Below are the operations you can execute on the stack:
1. Push (Insert an element)
2. Pop (Deletes last element)
3. Show (Lists all elements in the stack)
4. Quit (Exit program)

Please enter your choice from 1 to 4: 2

Integer deleted: 5
```

Now, the stack is empty. Attempt to `pop()` again:<br>
```
Below are the operations you can execute on the stack:
1. Push (Insert an element)
2. Pop (Deletes last element)
3. Show (Lists all elements in the stack)
4. Quit (Exit program)

Please enter your choice from 1 to 4: 2

Stack is already empty!
```

You may keep experimenting to understand how stacks work.<br> 

_**NOTE:** Please ensure you always input an integer as the program is not yet designed to take in non-integers as input._
